# C_GEOMETRY

It's a simple library, work in progress, made to help about 2d geomtries.
<br>
The idea is to help managing lines, segments, triangles, intersections, collisions...
<br>
There is a demo based on the SDL2 lib. Run `make demo` to try it out.
<br>
For now it shows how we can perform raycasts and other things with the lib.
<br>
##TO DO
* Improve tests :)
* Make more demos.
* Get angle between segs/lines if intersections.
* Use triangles to create a polygon object by intersecting triangles.
